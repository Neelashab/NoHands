"""
Decision making is the function where the car will decide whether to start, move forward, stop, or change direction (left, right). 

We will recieve a trajectory from the target_road_segment_id. We should define a polyline and connect the line. The polyline may have some straight lines and some curves. Define the bandwith


This will power the pure pursuit controller. We will attempt to match the current path of the vehicle to the given path with minimal error using the control law.

We will define a timestep/look ahead distance that will move the car forward X steps at a time. You will fetch the information at each timestep to make a decision about how to move forward.

The car will recieve information from latest_localization_state and latest_perception_state. latest_perception_state will help us understand where the car is in given input of the map. 

Avoid obstacles using heuristics. See stop sign = stop. See
