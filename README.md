Autonomous Vehicle Project


This project addresses the challenge of developing a fully autonomous vehicle navigation system capable of traversing urban environments. Our design is built on a simple one-lane road network and aims to route a vehicle to a series of loading zones while adhering to traffic rules. 
     
We decomposed the autonomous driving problem into its primary components: routing, localization, perception, and motion planning (decision making). Upon completion of these individual systems, we integrated them to create an autonomous vehicle controller that can interpret its environment, plan actions, and execute them safely. 



Please refer to CarDemo.mov for the autonomous system in action, and the technical report for a comprehensive explanation, testing, and analysis of each component.
